## Flutter Web Dashboard Clone

This project aims to replicate the design of a web app dashboard using Flutter for web. The dashboard design serves as a practical exercise in UI/UX design and Flutter web development, inspired by a design found on Dribbble. By cloning an existing web dashboard, we aim to learn and practice various Flutter widgets, layout techniques, and responsive design principles.

### Features:

- **Responsive layout:** The dashboard will adapt to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience across devices.
- **Widget diversity:** Explore different Flutter widgets and customizations to recreate the dashboard's components accurately.
- **Interactive elements:** Implement interactive elements such as buttons, charts, and navigation to mimic the original dashboard's functionality.
- **Styling and theming:** Experiment with Flutter's styling and theming capabilities to achieve a polished and visually appealing interface.

### Technologies Used:

- **Flutter:** A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Dart:** The programming language used with Flutter, providing a fast, object-oriented, and JIT-compiled environment.

### Design Inspiration:

The design of this dashboard is inspired by a UI design found on Dribbble. Credit goes to **Max Panchyk** for the original design concept. You can visit the design here [Max Panchyk(H Care Medical App)](https://dribbble.com/shots/8813361-H-care-Medical-App)
